delivery mechanism. Over the past few months there has been \nmuch back and forth over the fact that director Peter Jackson planned to show the \nfilm in 48 frames per second, instead of the traditional 24. I’ve got to say, I don’t like \nit too much. The images do have a stunning clarity to them. In close up shots you can \npractically count each and every pore on an actor’s face. And it does seem to \nalleviate some of the eyestrain that pops up with 3D. \n \n \nThose are the good points, but the bad so much outweighs the positives that I have \nto recommend trying to find a screening at 24fps. The biggest issue is going to be the \nmotion sickness. Seriously, you might want to take a Dramamine. Every camera \nmovement, every sweeping pan, every epic helicopter shot—and there’s a crap ton \nof all of them—is enough to make you nauseous. Even more low-key shots, like \ntracking around Bilbo’s hobbit hole, elicit the same response. Especially disorienting \nin moments of hectic action—something else “The Hobbit” has a great deal of—you \nfeel like you’re being whipped around by a roller coaster, and not in a fun way. \nTalking to people, some warm up to this feeling over the course of the film, but I \nnever did. \n \nThe overall effect makes “The Hobbit” come across like a videogame, and the \ncharacters look like they’re pieces in an elaborate fantasy RPG. An increased frame \nrate also means that the digital effects don’t mesh as well with the organic images. In \nJackson’s “Lord of the Rings” films, the VFX blended in seamlessly, but that is \ndefinitely not the case here. At times the effects just look cheesy and bad, and \nresemble old movies where characters run in place in front of a rear projection \nscreen, or drive a stationary car while film of a street plays behind them. There are \nmoments that are almost comical. \n \nIt isn’t all bad, however. The Goblin King looks pretty damn awesome. He’s suitably \ngrotesque, covered in welts, open sores, and nasty boils. And he looks like he has \nballs dangling from his chin, so there’s that. There’s also one massive, badass brawl \nbetween stone giants that’s pretty spectacular, and all of scenes of the underground \nrealms are damn nice to gawk at. \n \nWhile the presentation of “The Hobbit” is huge, huge distraction, the rest of the \nmovie is also something of a letdown. We’ve all heard jokes about how the “Lord of \nthe Rings” is mostly walking, but even as much time as those movies take, there is\n\"\"\"\n\n**Page 2**\n\"\"\"\nalways forward movement. “The Hobbit” on the other hand, is full of places where \nthe pace just stops dead in its tracks like it slammed into a wall. An extended \nprologue sets up the story: Bilbo (Martin Freeman) is convinced to go on an epic \nquest to help a group of dwarves, led by Rob Zombie lookalike Thorin Oakenshield \n(Richard Armitage), to reclaim their former kingdom, which has been taken over by a \ngold-hoarding dragon. \n \nEven by the weirdly skewed standards by which we judge a Peter Jackson adaptation \nof a beloved J.R.R. Tolkien novel, “The Hobbit” drags. The introductory dinner scene, \nwhere Bilbo meets his cave-dwelling companions, is the first instance where the film \ngoes on too long, meandering on well after the point has been made and beaten like \nthe proverbial dead horse. \n \nAbandoning his comfort zone, the reluctant little adventurer accompanies his \nstubborn, volatile, head-butting companions. From his sleepy small town home, they \ntravel into the great wilderness of Middle Earth. On the road they encounter all \nmanner of creatures, dangers, and hazards; there are wizards, orcs, elves, and, of \ncourse, Gollum, to contend with. \n \nOver the course of their journey, the company engages in many an epic battle. This is \nanother area where “The Hobbit” pales in comparison to the “Lord of the Rings”. \nWhile the earlier films were full of grim, dirty combat, the fourth film in the cannon \nrelies on gimmicks and lame tricks. Every time the crew gets down to fighting, you \nget the impression that they’re trying so hard to make the battles feel different, that \nthey’re just throwing things in at random. Instead of badass swordplay and limb \nhacking, you get attempts to be clever that only succeed pulling you out of the \nmoment. One particular action sequence takes place on a series of wood and rope \nbridges that are apparently so fragile a hobbit can barely walk on them. Until a piece \nof bridge falls off and the company goes sledding down thousands of feet into a \ncavern. When that happens it holds up shockingly well. Jackson and friends try to be \ntoo clever when what they need is more straight up violence. \n \n“The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey” isn’t terrible, in fact it is fine, but it could be so \nmuch better. It should be great, but the overuse of CGI, a questionable choice in \npresentation, and serious pacing issues derail the true potential. In the end you’re \nleft wondering how it went that way, and how in the hell are they going to squeeze \ntwo more movies out of this?\n\"\"\"\n\n", "document_id": "doc_3c49529f"}
