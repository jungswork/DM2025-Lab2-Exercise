&quot;&quot;&quot;
It’s impossible for me to talk about “The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey” without 
first discussing the delivery mechanism. Over the past few months there has been 
much back and forth over the fact that director Peter Jackson planned to show the 
film in 48 frames per second, instead of the traditional 24. I’ve got to say, <span class="lx-highlight lx-current-highlight" data-idx="0" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">I don’t like 
it too much</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="1" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">The images do have a stunning clarity to them</span>. In close up shots you can 
practically count each and every pore on an actor’s face. And <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="2" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">it does seem to 
alleviate some of the eyestrain that pops up with 3D</span>. 


Those are the good points, but <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="3" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the bad so much outweighs the positives</span> that <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="4" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">I have 
to recommend trying to find a screening at 24fps</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="5" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">The biggest issue is going to be the 
motion sickness</span>. Seriously, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="6" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">you might want to take a Dramamine</span>. Every camera 
movement, every sweeping pan, every epic helicopter shot—and there’s a crap ton 
of all of them—is <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="7" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">enough to make you nauseous</span>. Even more low-key shots, like 
tracking around Bilbo’s hobbit hole, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="8" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">elicit the same response</span>. Especially disorienting 
in moments of hectic action—something else “The Hobbit” has a great deal of—<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="9" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">you 
feel like you’re being whipped around by a roller coaster, and not in a fun way</span>. 
Talking to people, some warm up to this feeling over the course of the film, but I 
never did. 

<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="10" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">The overall effect makes “The Hobbit” come across like a videogame</span>, and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="11" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the 
characters look like they’re pieces in an elaborate fantasy RPG</span>. An increased frame 
rate also means that <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="12" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the digital effects don’t mesh as well with the organic images</span>. In 
Jackson’s “Lord of the Rings” films, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="13" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the VFX blended in seamlessly</span>, but <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="14" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">that is 
definitely not the case here</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="15" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">At times the effects just look cheesy and bad</span>, and 
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="16" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">resemble old movies where characters run in place in front of a rear projection 
screen, or drive a stationary car while film of a street plays behind them</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="17" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">There are 
moments that are almost comical</span>. 

It isn’t all bad, however. The Goblin King looks <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="18" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">pretty damn awesome</span>. He’s <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="19" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">suitably 
grotesque</span>, covered in welts, open sores, and nasty boils. And he <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="20" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">looks like he has 
balls dangling from his chin</span>, so there’s that. There’s also <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="21" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">one massive, badass brawl 
between stone giants that’s pretty spectacular</span>, and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="22" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">all of scenes of the underground 
realms are damn nice to gawk at</span>. 

While <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="23" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the presentation of “The Hobbit” is huge, huge distraction</span>, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="24" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the rest of the 
movie is also something of a letdown</span>. We’ve all heard jokes about how the “Lord of 
the Rings” is mostly walking, but even as much time as those movies take, there is
&quot;&quot;&quot;

&quot;&quot;&quot;
always forward movement. “The Hobbit” on the other hand, is full of places where 
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="25" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the pace just stops dead in its tracks like it slammed into a wall</span>. An extended 
prologue sets up the story: Bilbo (Martin Freeman) is convinced to go on an epic 
quest to help a group of dwarves, led by Rob Zombie lookalike Thorin Oakenshield 
(Richard Armitage), to reclaim their former kingdom, which has been taken over by a 
gold-hoarding dragon. 

<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="26" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Even by the weirdly skewed standards by which we judge a Peter Jackson adaptation 
of a beloved J.R.R. Tolkien novel, “The Hobbit” drags</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="27" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">The introductory dinner scene</span>, 
where Bilbo meets his cave-dwelling companions, is the first instance where the film 
goes on too long, meandering on well after the point has been made and beaten like 
the proverbial dead horse. 

Abandoning his comfort zone, the reluctant little adventurer accompanies his 
stubborn, volatile, head-butting companions. From his sleepy small town home, they 
travel into the great wilderness of Middle Earth. On the road they encounter all 
manner of creatures, dangers, and hazards; there are wizards, orcs, elves, and, of 
course, Gollum, to contend with. 

Over the course of their journey, the company engages in many an epic battle. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="28" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">This is 
another area where “The Hobbit” pales in comparison to the “Lord of the Rings</span>”. 
While the earlier films were full of grim, dirty combat, the fourth film in the cannon 
relies on <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="29" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">gimmicks and lame tricks</span>. Every time the crew gets down to fighting, you 
get the impression that they’re <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="30" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">trying so hard to make the battles feel different, that 
they’re just throwing things in at random</span>. Instead of badass swordplay and limb 
hacking, you get <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="31" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">attempts to be clever that only succeed <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="32" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">pulling you out of the 
moment</span></span>. One particular action sequence takes place on a series of wood and rope 
bridges that are apparently so fragile a hobbit can barely walk on them. Until a piece 
of bridge falls off and the company goes sledding down thousands of feet into a 
cavern. When that happens it <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="33" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">holds up shockingly well</span>. Jackson and friends <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="34" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">try to be 
too clever</span> when what they need is more straight up violence. 

“The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey” isn’t terrible, in fact it is <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="35" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">fine</span>, but it <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="36" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">could be so 
much better</span>. It <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="37" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">should be great</span>, but the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="38" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">overuse of CGI, a questionable choice in 
presentation, and serious pacing issues derail the true potential</span>. In the end you’re 
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="39" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">left wondering how it went that way</span>, and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="40" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">how in the hell are they going to squeeze 
two more movies out of this?</span>
